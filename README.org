* Smart Animated Wallpaper
** What is it?
   Some really bad piece of code I tinkered together at 4 am instead of sleeping that uses xwinwrap and mpv to display media as wallpapers on linux (works at least on i3-wm)
** Is it a good idea?
   no
** What are the dependencies?
   xrandr and mpv mostly (xwinwrap should be cloned)
** How to build
  build xwinwrap (with make) so that the executable is in the xwinwrap/ folder (just call make while being in it, really)
** How to use
   ~python script.py <Path To Your gif/video/image/capybara>~
